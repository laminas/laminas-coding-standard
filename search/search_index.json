Overview This specification extends PSR-12 , the coding style guide and requires adherence to PSR-1 , the basic coding standard. Like PSR-12 , the intent of this specification is to reduce cognitive friction when scanning code from different authors contributing to Laminas. It does so by enumerating a shared set of rules and expectations about how to format PHP code. 1.1 Previous language versions Throughout this document, any instructions MAY be ignored if they do not exist in versions of PHP supported by your project. 1.2 Example This example encompasses some of the rules below as a quick overview: <?php /** * @see https://github.com/mezzio/mezzio for the canonical source repository * @copyright https://github.com/mezzio/mezzio/blob/master/COPYRIGHT.md * @license https://github.com/mezzio/mezzio/blob/master/LICENSE.md New BSD License */ declare(strict_types=1); namespace Mezzio; use Psr\\Http\\Message\\ResponseInterface; use Psr\\Http\\Message\\ServerRequestInterface; use Psr\\Http\\Server\\MiddlewareInterface; use Psr\\Http\\Server\\RequestHandlerInterface; use Mezzio\\Router\\RouteCollector; use Laminas\\HttpHandlerRunner\\RequestHandlerRunner; use Laminas\\Stratigility\\MiddlewarePipeInterface; use function Laminas\\Stratigility\\path; class Application implements MiddlewareInterface, RequestHandlerInterface { /** @var MiddlewareFactory */ private $factory; /** @var MiddlewarePipeInterface */ private $pipeline; /** @var RouteCollector */ private $routes; /** @var RequestHandlerRunner */ private $runner; public function __construct( MiddlewareFactory $factory, MiddlewarePipeInterface $pipeline, RouteCollector $routes, RequestHandlerRunner $runner ) { $this->factory = $factory; $this->pipeline = $pipeline; $this->routes = $routes; $this->runner = $runner; } /** * Proxies to composed pipeline to handle. * {@inheritDocs} */ public function handle(ServerRequestInterface $request) : ResponseInterface { return $this->pipeline->handle($request); } /** * Run the application. * * Proxies to the RequestHandlerRunner::run() method. */ public function run() : void { $this->runner->run(); } } 2. General 2.1 Basic Coding Standard Code MUST follow all rules outlined in PSR-1 . The term 'StudlyCaps' in PSR-1 MUST be interpreted as PascalCase where the first letter of each word is capitalized including the very first letter. Additional Laminas rules For consistency a bunch of older PHP features SHOULD NOT be used: The short open tag SHOULD NOT be used. Deprecated features SHOULD be avoided ( [7.0] , [7.1] , [7.2] , [7.3] , [7.4] ) The backtick operator MUST NOT be used. The goto language construct SHOULD NOT be used. The global keyword MUST NOT be used. The constant PHP_SAPI SHOULD be used instead of the php_sapi_name() function. aliases SHOULD NOT be used. There MUST NOT be a space before a semicolon. Redundant semicolons SHOULD be avoided. Non executable code MUST be removed. There MUST be a single space after language constructs. Parentheses MUST be omitted where possible. PHP function calls MUST be in lowercase. 2.2 Files Additional Laminas rules There MAY NOT be any content before the opening tag. Inline HTML in PHP code SHOULD be avoided. All code MUST be executable and non executable code SHOULD be removed. The declare(strict_types=1) directive MUST be declared and be the first statement in a file. All PHP files MUST use the Unix LF (linefeed) line ending only. All PHP files MUST end with a non-blank line, terminated with a single LF. The closing ?> tag MUST be omitted from files containing only PHP. 2.3 Lines There MUST NOT be a hard limit on line length. The soft limit on line length MUST be 120 characters. Lines SHOULD NOT be longer than 80 characters; lines longer than that SHOULD be split into multiple subsequent lines of no more than 80 characters each. There MUST NOT be trailing whitespace at the end of lines. Blank lines MAY be added to improve readability and to indicate related blocks of code except where explicitly forbidden. Additional Laminas rules There MAY be maximum one blank line to improve readability and to indicate related blocks of code except where explicitly forbidden. There MAY NOT be any blank line after opening braces and before closing braces. There MUST NOT be more than one statement per line. Additional Laminas rules There MUST NOT be a space before a semicolon. Redundant semicolons SHOULD be avoided. 2.4 Indenting and Spacing Code MUST use an indent of 4 spaces for each indent level, and MUST NOT use tabs for indenting. Additional Laminas rules Encapsed strings MAY be used instead of concatenating strings. When concatenating strings, there MUST be a single whitespace before and after the concatenation operator. The concatenation operator MUST NOT be the at the end of a line. If multi-line concatenation is used there MUST be an indent of 4 spaces. // Encapsed strings $a = 'foo'; $b = 'bar'; $c = \"I like $a and $b\"; // Concatenating $a = 'Hello '; $b = $a . 'World!'; 2.5 Keywords and Types All PHP reserved keywords and types [1] [2] MUST be in lower case. Any new types and keywords added to future PHP versions MUST be in lower case. Short form of type keywords MUST be used i.e. bool instead of boolean , int instead of integer etc. 2.6 Variables Additional Laminas rules Variable names MUST be declared in camelCase. 2.7 Arrays Additional Laminas rules The short array syntax MUST be used to define arrays. All values in multiline arrays must be indented with 4 spaces. All array values must be followed by a comma, including the last value. There MUST NOT be whitespace around the opening bracket or before the closing bracket when referencing an array. All double arrow symbols MUST be aligned to one space after the longest array key. $array2 = [ 'one' => function () { $foo = [1, 2, 3]; $barBar = [ 1, 2, 3, ]; }, 'longer' => 2, 3 => 'three', ]; The short list syntax [...] SHOULD be used instead of list(...) . [$a, $b, $c] = [1, 2, 3]; 3. Declare Statements, Namespace, and Import Statements The header of a PHP file may consist of a number of different blocks. If present, each of the blocks below MUST be separated by a single blank line, and MUST NOT contain a blank line. Each block MUST be in the order listed below, although blocks that are not relevant may be omitted. Opening <?php tag. File-level docblock. One or more declare statements. The namespace declaration of the file. One or more class-based use import statements. One or more function-based use import statements. One or more constant-based use import statements. The remainder of the code in the file. When a file contains a mix of HTML and PHP, any of the above sections may still be used. If so, they MUST be present at the top of the file, even if the remainder of the code consists of a closing PHP tag and then a mixture of HTML and PHP. When the opening <?php tag is on the first line of the file, it MUST be on its own line with no other statements unless it is a file containing markup outside of PHP opening and closing tags. Import statements MUST never begin with a leading backslash as they must always be fully qualified. Additional Laminas rules There MUST be a single space after the namespace keyword and there MAY NOT be a space around a namespace separator. Import statements MUST be alphabetically sorted. Unused import statements SHOULD be removed. Fancy group import statements MUST NOT be used. Each import statement MUST be on its own line. Import statement aliases for classes, traits, functions and constants MUST be useful, meaning that aliases SHOULD only be used if a class with the same name is imported. Classes, traits, interfaces, constants and functions MUST be imported. The following example illustrates a complete list of all blocks: <?php /** * This file contains an example of coding styles. */ declare(strict_types=1); namespace Vendor\\Package; use Vendor\\Package\\ClassA as A; use Vendor\\Package\\ClassB; use Vendor\\Package\\ClassC as C; use Vendor\\Package\\SomeNamespace\\ClassD as D; use Vendor\\Package\\AnotherNamespace\\ClassE as E; use function Vendor\\Package\\functionA; use function Vendor\\Package\\functionB; use function Another\\Vendor\\functionC; use const Vendor\\Package\\CONSTANT_A; use const Vendor\\Package\\CONSTANT_B; use const Another\\Vendor\\CONSTANT_C; /** * FooBar is an example class. */ class FooBar { // ... additional PHP code ... } Compound namespaces with a depth of more than two MUST NOT be used. Therefore the following is the maximum compounding depth allowed: use Vendor\\Package\\SomeNamespace\\{ SubnamespaceOne\\ClassA, SubnamespaceOne\\ClassB, SubnamespaceTwo\\ClassY, ClassZ, }; And the following would not be allowed: use Vendor\\Package\\SomeNamespace\\{ SubnamespaceOne\\AnotherNamespace\\ClassA, SubnamespaceOne\\ClassB, ClassZ, }; When wishing to declare strict types in files containing markup outside PHP opening and closing tags, the declaration MUST be on the first line of the file and include an opening PHP tag, the strict types declaration and closing tag. For example: <?php declare(strict_types=1) ?> <html> <body> <?php // ... additional PHP code ... ?> </body> </html> Declare statements MUST contain no spaces and MUST be exactly declare(strict_types=1) (with an optional semi-colon terminator). Block declare statements are allowed and MUST be formatted as below. Note position of braces and spacing: declare(ticks=1) { // some code } 4. Classes, Properties, and Methods The term \"class\" refers to all classes, interfaces, and traits. Any closing brace MUST NOT be followed by any comment or statement on the same line. When instantiating a new class, parentheses MUST always be present even when there are no arguments passed to the constructor. new Foo(); Additional Laminas rules There MUST NOT be duplicate class names. The file name MUST match the case of the terminating class name. PHP 4 style constructors MUST NOT be used. Correct class name casing MUST be used. Abstract classes MUST have a Abstract prefix. Exception classes MUST have a Exception suffix. Interface classes MUST have a Interface suffix. Trait classes MUST have a Trait suffix. For self-reference a class lower-case self:: MUST be used without spaces around the scope resolution operator. Class name resolution via ::class MUST be used instead of __CLASS__ , get_class() , get_class($this) , get_called_class() , get_parent_class() and string reference. There MAY NOT be any whitespace around the double colon operator. Unused private methods, constants and properties MUST be removed. 4.1 Extends and Implements The extends and implements keywords MUST be declared on the same line as the class name. The opening brace for the class MUST go on its own line; the closing brace for the class MUST go on the next line after the body. Opening braces MUST be on their own line and MUST NOT be preceded or followed by a blank line. Closing braces MUST be on their own line and MUST NOT be preceded by a blank line. namespace Vendor\\Package; use FooClass; use BarClass as Bar; use OtherVendor\\OtherPackage\\BazClass; class ClassName extends ParentClass implements \\ArrayAccess, \\Countable { // constants, properties, methods } Lists of implements and, in the case of interfaces, extends MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one interface per line. namespace Vendor\\Package; use FooClass; use BarClass as Bar; use OtherVendor\\OtherPackage\\BazClass; class ClassName extends ParentClass implements \\ArrayAccess, \\Countable, \\Serializable { // constants, properties, methods } 4.2 Using traits The use keyword used inside the classes to implement traits MUST be declared on the next line after the opening brace. namespace Vendor\\Package; use Vendor\\Package\\FirstTrait; class ClassName { use FirstTrait; } Each individual trait that is imported into a class MUST be included one-per-line and each inclusion MUST have its own use import statement. Additional Laminas rules Traits MUST be sorted alphabetically. namespace Vendor\\Package; use Vendor\\Package\\FirstTrait; use Vendor\\Package\\SecondTrait; use Vendor\\Package\\ThirdTrait; class ClassName { use FirstTrait; use SecondTrait; use ThirdTrait; } When the class has nothing after the use import statement, the class closing brace MUST be on the next line after the use import statement. namespace Vendor\\Package; use Vendor\\Package\\FirstTrait; class ClassName { use FirstTrait; } Otherwise, it MUST have a blank line after the use import statement. namespace Vendor\\Package; use Vendor\\Package\\FirstTrait; class ClassName { use FirstTrait; private $property; } When using the insteadof and as operators they must be used as follows taking note of indentation, spacing, and new lines. class Talker { use A, B, C { B::smallTalk insteadof A; A::bigTalk insteadof C; C::mediumTalk as FooBar; } } 4.3 Properties and Constants Visibility MUST be declared on all properties. Visibility MUST be declared on all constants if your project PHP minimum version supports constant visibilities (PHP 7.1 or later). The var keyword MUST NOT be used to declare a property. There MUST NOT be more than one property declared per statement. Property names MUST NOT be prefixed with a single underscore to indicate protected or private visibility. That is, an underscore prefix explicitly has no meaning. There MUST be a space between type declaration and property name. Additional Laminas rules Default null values MUST be omitted for class properties. A property declaration looks like the following: class ClassName { public $foo; // `= null` should be omitted public static int $bar = 0; } 4.4 Methods and Functions Visibility MUST be declared on all methods. Method names MUST NOT be prefixed with a single underscore to indicate protected or private visibility. That is, an underscore prefix explicitly has no meaning. Method and function names MUST NOT be declared with space after the method name. The opening brace MUST go on its own line, and the closing brace MUST go on the next line following the body. There MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis, and there MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis. Additional Laminas rules There MUST be a single empty line between methods in a class. The pseudo-variable $this MUST NOT be called inside a static method or function. Returned variables SHOULD be useful and SHOULD NOT be assigned to a value and returned on the next line. A method declaration looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, commas, spaces, and braces: class ClassName { public function fooBarBaz($arg1, &$arg2, $arg3 = []) { // method body } } A function declaration looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, commas, spaces, and braces: function fooBarBaz($arg1, &$arg2, $arg3 = []) { // function body } 4.5 Method and Function Arguments In the argument list, there MUST NOT be a space before each comma, and there MUST be one space after each comma. Method and function arguments with default values MUST go at the end of the argument list. class ClassName { public function foo(int $arg1, &$arg2, $arg3 = []) { // method body } } Argument lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one argument per line. When the argument list is split across multiple lines, the closing parenthesis and opening brace MUST be placed together on their own line with one space between them. class ClassName { public function aVeryLongMethodName( ClassTypeHint $arg1, &$arg2, array $arg3 = [] ) { // method body } } When you have a return type declaration present, there MUST be one space after the colon followed by the type declaration. The colon and declaration MUST be on the same line as the argument list closing parenthesis with no spaces between the two characters. class ReturnTypeVariations { public function functionName(int $arg1, $arg2): string { return 'foo'; } public function anotherFunction( string $foo, string $bar, int $baz ): string { return 'foo'; } } In nullable type declarations, there MUST NOT be a space between the question mark and the type. Additional Laminas rules The question mark MUST be used when the default argument value is null. class ReturnTypeVariations { public function functionName(?string $arg1, ?int &$arg2 = null): ?string { return 'foo'; } } When using the reference operator & before an argument, there MUST NOT be a space after it, like in the previous example. There MUST NOT be a space between the variadic three dot operator and the argument name: public function process(string $algorithm, ...$parts) { // processing } When combining both the reference operator and the variadic three dot operator, there MUST NOT be any space between the two of them: public function process(string $algorithm, &...$parts) { // processing } 4.6 abstract , final , and static When present, the abstract and final declarations MUST precede the visibility declaration. Additional Laminas rules The final keyword on methods MUST be omitted in final declared classes. When present, the static declaration MUST come after the visibility declaration. abstract class ClassName { protected static $foo; abstract protected function zim(); final public static function bar() { // method body } } 4.7 Method and Function Calls When making a method or function call, there MUST NOT be a space between the method or function name and the opening parenthesis, there MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis, and there MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis. In the argument list, there MUST NOT be a space before each comma, and there MUST be one space after each comma. bar(); $foo->bar($arg1); Foo::bar($arg2, $arg3); Argument lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one argument per line. A single argument being split across multiple lines (as might be the case with an anonymous function or array) does not constitute splitting the argument list itself. $foo->bar( $longArgument, $longerArgument, $muchLongerArgument ); somefunction($foo, $bar, [ // ... ], $baz); $app->get('/hello/{name}', function ($name) use ($app) { return 'Hello ' . $app->escape($name); }); 5. Control Structures The general style rules for control structures are as follows: There MUST be one space after the control structure keyword There MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis There MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis There MUST be one space between the closing parenthesis and the opening brace The structure body MUST be indented once The body MUST be on the next line after the opening brace The closing brace MUST be on the next line after the body The body of each structure MUST be enclosed by braces. This standardizes how the structures look and reduces the likelihood of introducing errors as new lines get added to the body. Additional Laminas rules There MUST be one single space after break and continue structures with a numeric argument argument. Statements MUST NOT be empty, except for catch statements. 5.1 if , elseif , else An if structure looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, spaces, and braces; and that else and elseif are on the same line as the closing brace from the earlier body. if ($expr1) { // if body } elseif ($expr2) { // elseif body } else { // else body; } The keyword elseif SHOULD be used instead of else if so that all control keywords look like single words. Expressions in parentheses MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented at least once. When doing so, the first condition MUST be on the next line. The closing parenthesis and opening brace MUST be placed together on their own line with one space between them. Boolean operators between conditions MUST always be at the beginning or at the end of the line, not a mix of both. if ( $expr1 && $expr2 ) { // if body } elseif ( $expr3 && $expr4 ) { // elseif body } 5.2 switch , case A switch structure looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, spaces, and braces. The case statement MUST be indented once from switch , and the break keyword (or other terminating keywords) MUST be indented at the same level as the case body. There MUST be a comment such as // no break when fall-through is intentional in a non-empty case body. Additional Laminas rules The continue control structure MUST NOT be used in switch statements, break SHOULD be used instead. switch ($expr) { case 0: echo 'First case, with a break'; break; case 1: echo 'Second case, which falls through'; // no break case 2: case 3: case 4: echo 'Third case, return instead of break'; return; default: echo 'Default case'; break; } Expressions in parentheses MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented at least once. When doing so, the first condition MUST be on the next line. The closing parenthesis and opening brace MUST be placed together on their own line with one space between them. Boolean operators between conditions MUST always be at the beginning or at the end of the line, not a mix of both. switch ( $expr1 && $expr2 ) { // structure body } 5.3 while , do while A while statement looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, spaces, and braces. while ($expr) { // structure body } Expressions in parentheses MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented at least once. When doing so, the first condition MUST be on the next line. The closing parenthesis and opening brace MUST be placed together on their own line with one space between them. Boolean operators between conditions MUST always be at the beginning or at the end of the line, not a mix of both. while ( $expr1 && $expr2 ) { // structure body } Similarly, a do while statement looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, spaces, and braces. do { // structure body; } while ($expr); Expressions in parentheses MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented at least once. When doing so, the first condition MUST be on the next line. Boolean operators between conditions MUST always be at the beginning or at the end of the line, not a mix of both. do { // structure body; } while ( $expr1 && $expr2 ); 5.4 for A for statement looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, spaces, and braces. for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) { // for body } Expressions in parentheses MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented at least once. When doing so, the first expression MUST be on the next line. The closing parenthesis and opening brace MUST be placed together on their own line with one space between them. for ( $i = 0; $i < 10; $i++ ) { // for body } 5.5 foreach A foreach statement looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, spaces, and braces. foreach ($iterable as $key => $value) { // foreach body } 5.6 try , catch , finally A try-catch-finally block looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, spaces, and braces. try { // try body } catch (FirstThrowableType $e) { // catch body } catch (OtherThrowableType | AnotherThrowableType $e) { // catch body } finally { // finally body } Additional Laminas rules All catch blocks MUST be reachable. 6. Operators Style rules for operators are grouped by arity (the number of operands they take). When space is permitted around an operator, multiple spaces MAY be used for readability purposes. Additional Laminas rules There MUST be at least one space on either side of an equals sign used to assign a value to a variable. In case of a block of related assignments, more spaces MUST be inserted before the equal sign to promote readability. There MUST NOT be any white space around the object operator UNLESS multilines are used. Loose comparison operators SHOULD NOT be used, use strict comparison operators instead. e.g. use === instead of == . The null coalesce operator SHOULD be used when possible. Assignment operators SHOULD be used when possible. The && and || operators SHOULD be used instead of and and or . All operators not described here are left undefined. 6.1. Unary operators The increment/decrement operators MUST NOT have any space between the operator and operand. $i++; ++$j; Type casting operators MUST NOT have any space within the parentheses. Additional Laminas rules There MUST be one whitespace after a type casting operator. $intValue = (int) $input; Additional Laminas rules There MUST be one whitespace after unary not. if (! true) { return false; } 6.2. Binary operators All binary arithmetic , comparison , assignment , bitwise , logical , string , and type operators MUST be preceded and followed by at least one space: if ($a === $b) { $foo = $bar ?? $a ?? $b; } elseif ($a > $b) { $foo = $a + $b * $c; } 6.3. Ternary operators The conditional operator, also known simply as the ternary operator, MUST be preceded and followed by at least one space around both the ? and : characters: $variable = $foo ? 'foo' : 'bar'; When the middle operand of the conditional operator is omitted, the operator MUST follow the same style rules as other binary comparison operators: $variable = $foo ?: 'bar'; 7. Closures Closures MUST be declared with a space after the function keyword, and a space before and after the use keyword. The opening brace MUST go on the same line, and the closing brace MUST go on the next line following the body. There MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis of the argument list or variable list, and there MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis of the argument list or variable list. In the argument list and variable list, there MUST NOT be a space before each comma, and there MUST be one space after each comma. Closure arguments with default values MUST go at the end of the argument list. If a return type is present, it MUST follow the same rules as with normal functions and methods; if the use keyword is present, the colon MUST follow the use list closing parentheses with no spaces between the two characters. Additional Laminas rules Inherited variables passed via use MUST be used in closures. A closure declaration looks like the following. Note the placement of parentheses, commas, spaces, and braces: $closureWithArgs = function ($arg1, $arg2) { // body }; $closureWithArgsAndVars = function ($arg1, $arg2) use ($var1, $var2) { // body }; $closureWithArgsVarsAndReturn = function ($arg1, $arg2) use ($var1, $var2): bool { // body }; Argument lists and variable lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one argument or variable per line. When the ending list (whether of arguments or variables) is split across multiple lines, the closing parenthesis and opening brace MUST be placed together on their own line with one space between them. The following are examples of closures with and without argument lists and variable lists split across multiple lines. $longArgs_noVars = function ( $longArgument, $longerArgument, $muchLongerArgument ) { // body }; $noArgs_longVars = function () use ( $longVar1, $longerVar2, $muchLongerVar3 ) { // body }; $longArgs_longVars = function ( $longArgument, $longerArgument, $muchLongerArgument ) use ( $longVar1, $longerVar2, $muchLongerVar3 ) { // body }; $longArgs_shortVars = function ( $longArgument, $longerArgument, $muchLongerArgument ) use ($var1) { // body }; $shortArgs_longVars = function ($arg) use ( $longVar1, $longerVar2, $muchLongerVar3 ) { // body }; Note that the formatting rules also apply when the closure is used directly in a function or method call as an argument. $foo->bar( $arg1, function ($arg2) use ($var1) { // body }, $arg3 ); 8. Anonymous Classes Anonymous Classes MUST follow the same guidelines and principles as closures in the above section. $instance = new class {}; The opening brace MAY be on the same line as the class keyword so long as the list of implements interfaces does not wrap. If the list of interfaces wraps, the brace MUST be placed on the line immediately following the last interface. // Brace on the same line $instance = new class extends \\Foo implements \\HandleableInterface { // Class content }; // Brace on the next line $instance = new class extends \\Foo implements \\ArrayAccess, \\Countable, \\Serializable { // Class content }; 9. Commenting and DocBlocks Additional Laminas rules Code SHOULD be written so it explains itself. DocBlocks and comments SHOULD only be used if necessary. They MUST NOT start with # and MUST NOT be empty. They SHOULD NOT be used for already typehinted arguments, except arrays. The asterisks in a DocBlock should align, and there should be one space between the asterisk and tag. PHPDoc tags @param , @return and @throws SHOULD not be aligned or contain multiple spaces between the tag, type and description. If a function throws any exceptions, it SHOULD be documented with @throws tags. DocBlocks MUST follow this specific order of annotations with empty newline between specific groups: /** * <Summary> * * <Description> * * @internal * @deprecated * * @link * @see * @uses * * @param * @return * @throws */ The annotations @api , @author , @category , @created , @package , @subpackage and @version MUST NOT be used in comments. Git commits provide accurate information. The words private , protected , static , constructor , deconstructor , Created by , getter and setter , MUST NOT be used in comments. The @var tag MAY be used in inline comments to document the Type of properties. Single-line property comments with a @var tag SHOULD be written as one-liners. The @var MAY NOT be used for constants. The correct tag case of PHPDocs and PHPUnit tags MUST be used. Inline DocComments MAY be used at the end of the line, with at least a single space preceding. Inline DocComments MUST NOT be placed after curly brackets. Heredoc and nowdoc tags MUST be uppercase without spaces.","title":"Coding Style Guide"},{"location":"v2/coding-style-guide/#laminas-coding-style-guide","text":"The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 .","title":"Laminas Coding Style Guide"},{"location":"v2/coding-style-guide/#1-overview","text":"This specification extends PSR-12 , the coding style guide and requires adherence to PSR-1 , the basic coding standard.

If present, each of the blocks below MUST be separated by a single blank line, and MUST NOT contain a blank line. Each block MUST be in the order listed below, although blocks that are not relevant may be omitted. Opening <?php tag. File-level docblock. One or more declare statements. The namespace declaration of the file. One or more class-based use import statements. One or more function-based use import statements. One or more constant-based use import statements. The remainder of the code in the file. When a file contains a mix of HTML and PHP, any of the above sections may still be used. If so, they MUST be present at the top of the file, even if the remainder of the code consists of a closing PHP tag and then a mixture of HTML and PHP. When the opening <?php tag is on the first line of the file, it MUST be on its own line with no other statements unless it is a file containing markup outside of PHP opening and closing tags. Import statements MUST never begin with a leading backslash as they must always be fully qualified.","title":"3.

In the argument list and variable list, there MUST NOT be a space before each comma, and there MUST be one space after each comma.

Installation Install the module via Composer by running: $ composer require --dev laminas/laminas-coding-standard Add Composer scripts into your composer.json : \"scripts\": { \"cs-check\": \"phpcs\", \"cs-fix\": \"phpcbf\" } Create file phpcs.xml on base path of your repository with this content: <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <ruleset xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=\"vendor/squizlabs/php_codesniffer/phpcs.xsd\"> <arg name=\"basepath\" value=\".\"/> <arg name=\"cache\" value=\".phpcs-cache\"/> <arg name=\"colors\"/> <arg name=\"extensions\" value=\"php\"/> <arg name=\"parallel\" value=\"80\"/> <!-- Show progress --> <arg value=\"p\"/> <!-- Paths to check --> <file>config</file> <file>src</file> <file>test</file> <!-- Include all rules from the Laminas Coding Standard --> <rule ref=\"LaminasCodingStandard\"/> </ruleset> You can add or exclude some locations in that file. For a reference please see the \"Annotated Ruleset\" of PHP_CodeSniffer . Usage To run checks only: $ composer cs-check To automatically fix many CS issues: $ composer cs-fix Ignoring parts of a File Deprecation Before PHP_CodeSniffer version 3.2.0, // @codingStandardsIgnoreStart and // @codingStandardsIgnoreEnd were used. These are deprecated and will be removed in PHP_CodeSniffer version 4.0. Disable parts of a file: $xmlPackage = new XMLPackage; // phpcs:disable $xmlPackage['error_code'] = get_default_error_code_value(); $xmlPackage->send(); // phpcs:enable Disable a specific rule: // phpcs:disable Generic.Commenting.Todo.Found $xmlPackage = new XMLPackage; $xmlPackage['error_code'] = get_default_error_code_value(); // TODO: Add an error message here. $xmlPackage->send(); // phpcs:enable Development New Rules or Sniffs New rules or Sniffs may not be introduced in minor or bugfix releases and should always be based on the develop branch and queued for the next major release, unless considered a bugfix for existing rules. If you want to test changes against Laminas components or your own projects, install your forked laminas-coding-standard globally with Composer: $ composer global config repositories.laminas-coding-standard vcs git@github.com:<FORK_NAMESPACE>/laminas-coding-standard.git $ composer global require --dev laminas/laminas-coding-standard:dev-<FORKED_BRANCH> # For this to work, add this to your path: ~/.composer/vendor/bin # Using `-s` prints the rules that triggered the errors so they can be reviewed easily. `-p` is for progress display. $ phpcs -sp --standard=LaminasCodingStandard src test Make sure you remove the global installation after testing from your global composer.json file! Documentation can be previewed locally by installing MkDocs and run mkdocs serve . This will start a server where you can read the docs. Reference Rules can be added, excluded or tweaked locally, depending on your preferences.
